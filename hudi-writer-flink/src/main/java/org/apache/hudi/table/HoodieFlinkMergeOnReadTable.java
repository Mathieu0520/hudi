/**
 * Implementation of a more real-time Hoodie Table the provides tradeoffs on read and write cost/amplification.
 *
 * <p>
 * INSERTS - Same as HoodieCopyOnWriteTable - Produce new files, block aligned to desired size (or) Merge with the
 * smallest existing file, to expand it
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * UPDATES - Appends the changes to a rolling log file maintained per file Id. Compaction merges the log file into the
 * base file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * WARNING - MOR table type does not support nested rollbacks, every rollback must be followed by an attempted commit
 * action
 * </p>
